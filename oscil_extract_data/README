## ROOT dictionaries

This folder shows how to generate a ROOT dictionary. This is needed for reading
data from a binary ROOT file that has a custom structure. 

The steps used to generate a dictionary are:

1. Use `rootcint` on the headers and a *linkdef* file to generate a *Dict.cxx*
file.
2. Compile said *Dict.cxx* along with the implementation files for the headers.
3. Link *Dict.o* and any other objects to the final executable.
